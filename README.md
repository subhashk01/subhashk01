### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Subhash! I'm an undergraduate at MIT studying Physics and Computer Science originally from Jupiter, Florida. I love working on projects that leverage computer science to solve physical problems to positively impact society; right now the projects that Iâ€™m most interested in contributing to are Nuclear Fusion, the Mars Expedition, and Autonomous Vehicles. 

Outside of my academics I love meeting interesting people, reading memoirs, teaching and mentoring, playing basketball and ultimate frisbee, traveling to foreign countries, and exploring nature.
